## Getting Started

## Quick Install
To get started, you will need to download this repository to do so, download GitHub onto your raspberry pi using the following command:

```bash
sudo get install git -y
```
When this is complete, clone the relevant branches to the relevant Pis. Use this command to do so:
```bash
git clone github.com/da5905p/UoGACE/--BRANCH NAME--
```
*Where you change --BRANCH NAME-- for the relevenat branch i.e. Network, GUI.*

Note: Not all Pis need all branches to function. The list of which pis are required for which systems are below.

TouchScreen Pi = GUI, Network  
moonBuggy Pi = moonBuggy, Visual, Network  
Bases = Arm, Visual, Network
