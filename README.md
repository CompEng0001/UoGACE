# Advanced Computer Engineering Project
Documentation of the python code used in the Arm Branch of the ACE project.

## Software and Hardware used
Hardware used for this project: 
 - [x] Single Board Computers : Raspberry Pie, Jetson Nanos.
 - [x] Two Robotic Arms


 Language used for this project: Python.  
 Software used: Notepad, Nano and Visual Studio.
 
## Description
This is a separate branc of a larger project, ACE (Advanced Computer Engineering). This branch of the project involves developing code in order to allow any one user to control a robotic arm remotely as if it was in a robotic colony in Mars. The arm is intended to rotate left and right, rise up and down and adapt to grab and place, for instance, rocks and other objects into a deposit or storage working together with a rover styled remotely controlled car that was developed in another branch.
