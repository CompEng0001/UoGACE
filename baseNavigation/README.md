# Base Navigation

## Description
Live tracking GUI and positioning system

The system generates a map of the compound and displays the current location of the Rover in relation to the two bases.

The scripts will be uploaded to the Rover to create its own positioning system, whereby it will be able to  discern its location and direct itself to its target destination.

Further developments will see the Rover be able to update the map with obstacles encountered along the way

Techniques explored will be RSSI to triangulate between the wireless access points, and the A* algorithm to generate path planning solutions in roaming mode
